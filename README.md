# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-using-CNN

Plant disease detection using machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is an
important application of computer vision that has the potential to revolutionize agriculture. By
using machine learning algorithms to identify and diagnose plant diseases, farmers and
researchers can quickly and accurately detect and respond to disease outbreaks, reducing the
risk of crop loss and improving crop yields.
In this project, we will be using Python and the TensorFlow library to build a deep learning
model that can detect plant diseases from images. We will start by collecting a dataset of
images of healthy plants and plants affected by various diseases, and then preprocess the
images to prepare them for analysis.
Next, we will use a pre-trained CNN model such as VGG16 to extract features from the images,
and then train a classification model using these features. We will use techniques such as data
augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning to improve the accuracy of our model.
